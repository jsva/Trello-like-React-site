# Trello-like-React-site

A trello like React site, made following a course from Packt.
The course is:
## React.js Academy for beginners with Firebase
### By: Chris Dixon



NB: The course is old, so in order to make it work without major reconstructions by me, i have used many outdated versions of modules. Especially the firebase and routing modules i had to use older version as the newer versions had very different structures/calls. See the packgage and package-lock json files to see which versions were used.
One of the modules used (Textarea-Autosize) had to be force installed as it's not compatible with newer versions of react.

There was also a problem with the css file, due to either notepad or the unzipping tools on my system. I therefore wrote a python script to fix these issues for me.
